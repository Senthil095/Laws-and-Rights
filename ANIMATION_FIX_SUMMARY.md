# Animation and Question Skipping Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

The game was experiencing animation and question skipping issues when navigating between levels and categories. The root causes were:

### 1. **Missing React Keys**
- Animation components didn't have unique keys based on category/level
- React was reusing component instances instead of creating new ones
- This caused animations to skip or show cached state from previous levels

### 2. **State Not Resetting Between Levels**
- When navigating to a new level, component state persisted
- Timer, score, game state, and other variables retained old values
- Animations would appear to skip because they thought they were already complete

### 3. **Missing State Reset in Child Components**
- `ScenarioAnimation` component didn't reset when props changed
- `StickmanDrama` component didn't reset its scene counter when scenarioType changed
- This caused animations to continue from where they left off instead of restarting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Unique React Keys** (`page.jsx`)
- Added unique keys to all AnimatePresence motion divs: `key={category}-${level}`
- Added keys to animation components themselves for double safety
- This ensures React creates fresh component instances for each level

```javascript
// Before
<motion.div key="scenario-animation">
  <ScenarioAnimation ... />
</motion.div>

// After
<motion.div key={`scenario-${category}-${level}`}>
  <ScenarioAnimation key={`scenario-anim-${category}-${level}`} ... />
</motion.div>
```

### 2. **Complete State Reset on Level Change** (`page.jsx`)
Enhanced the useEffect that runs when category/level changes to reset ALL state:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const gameCategory = gameData[category]
  if (gameCategory && gameCategory.levels[level]) {
    const question = gameCategory.levels[level]
    setCurrentQuestion(question)
    // Reset all state when level changes
    setSelectedOption(null)
    setShowResult(false)
    setTimeLeft(0)
    setScore(0)
    setGameState("scenario")
    setShowAnimation(true)
    setGameStarted(false)
    setPointsEarned(0)
    setBadgeEarned(null)
  }
}, [category, level])
```

### 3. **ScenarioAnimation State Reset** (`scenario-animation.jsx`)
Added useEffect to reset animation state when scenario or scenarioType changes:

```javascript
// Reset state when scenario or scenarioType changes
useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentText("")
  setCurrentIndex(0)
  setShowDrama(false)
  setDramaComplete(false)
  setIsPlaying(true)
}, [scenario, scenarioType])
```

### 4. **StickmanDrama State Reset** (`stickman-drama.jsx`)
Added useEffect to reset scene counter and animation state when props change:

```javascript
// Reset state when scenarioType or outcome changes
useEffect(() => {
  setCurrentScene(0)
  setAnimationComplete(false)
}, [scenarioType, outcome])
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Navigating to a new level**: All animations start from the beginning
2. **Restarting the same level**: Animations replay completely  
3. **Different categories**: Each category's animations play correctly
4. **Success/Punishment screens**: Animations show properly for correct/incorrect answers

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate through all fundamental-rights levels (1-12)
- [ ] Navigate through all traffic-rules levels (1-10)
- [ ] Navigate through all criminal-law levels (1-12)
- [ ] Navigate through all consumer-rights levels (1-12)
- [ ] Navigate through all cyber-security levels (1-10)
- [ ] Test "Try Again" button - animations should replay
- [ ] Test "Next Level" button - new level should start fresh
- [ ] Verify scenario animations play completely
- [ ] Verify success animations show properly
- [ ] Verify punishment animations show properly
- [ ] Verify timer starts correctly on each level
- [ ] Verify score resets on each level

## Technical Details

### Component Hierarchy
```
GamePage
├── ScenarioAnimation (when gameState === "scenario")
│   └── StickmanDrama (shows setup animation)
├── Playing State (when gameState === "playing")
│   └── Question options
├── SuccessAnimation (when gameState === "success")
│   └── StickmanDrama (shows correct outcome)
└── PunishmentAnimation (when gameState === "punishment")
    └── StickmanDrama (shows wrong outcome)
```

### State Flow
1. User navigates to level → useEffect resets all state
2. gameState = "scenario" → ScenarioAnimation plays
3. Animation complete → gameState = "playing", timer starts
4. User submits answer → gameState = "success" or "punishment"
5. User clicks "Next Level" → Router navigates → useEffect resets state

## Files Modified

1. `/app/game/[category]/[level]/page.jsx` - Main game logic
2. `/components/scenario-animation.jsx` - Scenario intro animation
3. `/components/stickman-drama.jsx` - Animated drama scenes

## Notes

- All animation components now properly unmount and remount when level changes
- React keys ensure no component instance is reused across different levels
- State resets guarantee clean slate for each level
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing game data
