        ],
        explanation: "Article 15 of the Indian Constitution explicitly forbids the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds of religion. Since the college is government-run and forbids Rajesh access solely because of his religion, Article 15 is directly violated.",
        punishment: "Allowing such discrimination to go unchecked normalizes religious bias in educational institutions and violates constitutional principles of equality.",

          { id: "d", text: "Article 25 – Freedom of religion", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "A government college cannot discriminate on the basis of sex in hiring. Article 15(1) explicitly bans state discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Refusing to hire Suman solely for being a woman breaches Article 15's ban on sex-based discrimination.",

          { id: "d", text: "Article 32 – Right to constitutional remedies", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "Article 19(1)(a) guarantees every citizen the right to freedom of speech and expression. Forcing a journalist to stop writing or threatening her for her views is a violation of that right. The Constitution protects the freedom to publish opinions on public affairs.",
        punishment: "Not standing up for press freedom allows for the suppression of dissent and weakens democracy by limiting public access to critical information.",

        ],
        explanation: "Article 21 states that no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by law. Evicting people from their homes without any legal order or due process violates their right to live with dignity. The Supreme Court has interpreted 'life' to include livelihood and shelter.",
        punishment: "Failing to challenge such actions sets a dangerous precedent where the state can arbitrarily deprive citizens of their homes and livelihoods without due process.",
        timeLimit: 30,

        ],
        explanation: "Article 22(1) provides that anyone arrested must be informed 'as soon as may be' of the grounds for arrest, and cannot be detained without that knowledge. It also guarantees the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours. By not informing Rajiv of charges and detaining him for a week without judicial oversight, the police violated Article 22(1).",
        punishment: "Allowing such violations to go unchecked enables abuse of police powers and undermines the rule of law, putting everyone's liberty at risk.",
        timeLimit: 30,
        scenarioType: "arbitrary-arrest",
      },
      8: {
        title: "Prohibition of Forced Labor",
        scenario: "A landlord in Uttar Pradesh forces bonded laborers to work on his fields under threat of violence. The laborers have no freedom to leave and are paid nothing.",
        question: "Which Fundamental Right is being violated in this case?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "Article 21 – Right to life and personal liberty", correct: false },
          { id: "b", text: "Article 23 – Prohibition of forced labour and human trafficking", correct: true },

          { id: "d", text: "Article 25 – Freedom of religion", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "Article 23(1) of the Constitution expressly prohibits 'traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labor.' Forcing people to work against their will under threat clearly falls under 'forced labor.' The landlord's conduct is exactly the abuse Article 23 forbids.",
        punishment: "Failing to address forced labor allows modern-day slavery to persist, denying people their basic human dignity and freedom.",
        timeLimit: 30,
        scenarioType: "forced-labor",
      },
      9: {
        title: "Prohibition of Child Labor",
        scenario: "Twelve-year-old Meena works in a brick kiln, operating heavy machinery and handling dangerous materials. This is her only means of income, and she has missed school entirely.",
        question: "Which Fundamental Right is most directly violated by Meena's working conditions?",
        options: [
          { id: "a", text: "Article 23 – Prohibition of forced labour", correct: false },
          { id: "b", text: "Article 21 – Right to life and dignity", correct: false },

          { id: "d", text: "Article 19(1)(g) – Freedom to practice any profession", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "Article 24 explicitly states that 'No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.' Meena, being 12 and working in a hazardous kiln, is employed in violation of Article 24. This provision is absolute; no work conditions can justify it.",
        punishment: "Allowing child labor in hazardous conditions deprives children of their childhood, education, and future opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exploitation.",
        timeLimit: 30,
        scenarioType: "child-labor",

        scenario: "In a government-run school, teachers require all students to recite a specific Hindu prayer every morning, and punish those who refuse.",

          { id: "d", text: "Article 29 – Protection of culture and language", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "Article 28(1) states that 'No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds.' Forcing students to follow a specific prayer in a state school amounts to compulsory religious instruction, which Article 28 prohibits.",
        punishment: "Compulsory religious practices in state schools violate the secular nature of our democracy and infringe upon the religious freedom of students from different faiths.",
        timeLimit: 30,
        scenarioType: "religious-instruction",
      },

          { id: "d", text: "Article 14 – Equality before law", correct: false },
        ],
        explanation: "Article 30(1) guarantees that 'all minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.' This means the Sikh community can constitutionally found a school to teach in Punjabi.",
        punishment: "Denying minority communities the right to establish their own educational institutions undermines cultural diversity and the constitutional protection of minority rights.",
        timeLimit: 30,

        scenario: "Anand's daughter was illegally detained by police, but the local courts are slow to act. Anand decides to file a writ petition in the Supreme Court directly, claiming her fundamental rights are being violated.",
        question: "Which constitutional provision empowers Anand to approach the Supreme Court in this way?",

        ],
        explanation: "Article 32 guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court 'for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part' (the Fundamental Rights). This special remedy is available only under Article 32, allowing direct approach to the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights.",
        punishment: "Not being aware of Article 32 remedies could leave citizens without effective recourse when their fundamental rights are violated, especially in urgent situations.",
